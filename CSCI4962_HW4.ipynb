        "The model cell structure is exactly the same, other than the replacement of the SimpleRNN layer with a LSTM layer. The change in LSTM proved to provide negligable, if not worse, results in regards to accuracy, despite the time required to train being practically twice that of the simple RNN. This could potentially be explained by the fact that the average length of a tweet isn't too long at all since tweets are usually utilized as a means of expressing a single thought, moment, or idea in a quick and digestible manner. Thus, LSTMs, where their primary advantage over traditional RNNs is propagating dependence throughout an entire sequence regardless of length, most likely didn't produce much of a change in the model since our input sequences, the tweets, aren't very long at all on average."

You either can have your own idea of a dissimilarity score or refer to literature. In either case clearly describe how this score helps determine the dissmilarity between 2 words."
