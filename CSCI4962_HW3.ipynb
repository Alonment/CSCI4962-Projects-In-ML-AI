Ultimately, I arrived at a relatively large batch-size that provided a fair convergence speed along with decent accuracy, a small epoch size to decrease the likelihood of overfitting, and 128 neurons so that our rather large input set could be properly handled and fitted accordingly. With this combination of hyperparameters, the model appeared to perform much more consistently with fairly high accuracy when attempting to generalize outside of the training set.\n",

Out of all the optimizers that I tested the model with, Adam provided the most consistent convergence, high accuracies, and greatly decreasing losses per epoch. Furthermore, some research into the various algorithms also confirmed my findings as there appears to wide-ranging support of Adam for many of the same reasons in visual learning.\n",

However, I'm sure that implementing it could improve our model's ability to generalize even more, perhaps reaching as far as the $\\geq .99$ accuracy range."
